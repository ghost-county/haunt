## What Just Happened?

Haunt installed specialized AI agents, skills, rules, and workflows into your Claude Code environment. When you run `/seance`, it kicks off a planning ritual that:

1. Asks what you want to build
2. Breaks it into sized requirements
3. Creates a roadmap
4. Spawns agents to do the work

## Quick Commands
