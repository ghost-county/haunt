# Haunt Object Manifest
# Single source of truth for all Haunt framework assets (agents, rules, skills, commands)
#
# PURPOSE:
#   - Define all active Haunt objects with their source paths and deployment scope
#   - Track deprecated objects for automatic cleanup
#   - Enable verification that deployed objects match source of truth
#
# SCHEMA:
#   Active Sections (agents, rules, skills, commands):
#     - name: Base filename without extension (e.g., "gco-dev" not "gco-dev.md")
#     - scope: Where to deploy (global | project | both)
#       - global: Deploy to ~/.claude/ only
#       - project: Deploy to .claude/ only (project-specific customization)
#       - both: Deploy to both locations
#     - source: Relative path from Haunt/ directory to source file/directory
#
#   Deprecated Section:
#     - type: Type of object (agent | rule | skill | command)
#     - name: Object name (as it appears in ~/.claude/ or .claude/)
#     - removed: ISO date when deprecated (YYYY-MM-DD)
#     - reason: Brief explanation of why deprecated
#
# MAINTENANCE:
#   - Active sections: Auto-generated via `bash Haunt/scripts/utils/generate-manifest.sh`
#   - Deprecated section: MANUALLY maintained (never auto-generated)
#   - Update workflow:
#     1. Add/remove files in Haunt/agents/, rules/, skills/, commands/
#     2. Run generator to update active sections
#     3. Manually add deprecated entries when removing objects
#     4. Run setup-haunt.sh --clean to remove deprecated objects
