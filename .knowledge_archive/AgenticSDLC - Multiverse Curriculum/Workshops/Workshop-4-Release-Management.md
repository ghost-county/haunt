# Workshop 4: Release Management & Scaling

> *Coordinate merges, scale your team, and keep it all working.*

---

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Duration** | 60 minutes |
| **Format** | Architecture patterns + implementation |
| **Output** | Release manager agent, scaling strategy |
| **Prerequisites** | Multi-agent system from Workshop 3 |

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will:

- Implement a release manager agent for intelligent merging
- Understand when to parallelize vs. serialize work
- Scale agent teams effectively
- Set up review and documentation agents

---

## The Merge Problem

When multiple agents commit simultaneously:

```
         main
           │
     ┌─────┼─────┐
     │     │     │
   Roy   Jen   Moss
   API    UI   Infra
     │     │     │
     └─────┼─────┘
           │
           ?
```

Three agents finish at the same time. All three want to merge to main. What happens?

**Without coordination:**

- Merge conflicts
- Broken integrations
- Tests that passed individually fail together
- Rollback hell

**With a release manager:**

- Intelligent merge ordering
- Conflict detection before merge
- Integration testing between merges
- Clean history

---

## The Release Manager Agent

### Character Sheet

```markdown
# Agent: Release Manager

## Role
You are the release manager. Your job is to safely integrate work from all
development agents into the main branch while maintaining stability.

## Awareness
You must always know:
- Current state of main branch (last commit, test status)
- All pending merges (which agents, which requirements)
- Dependencies between changes
- Which systems each change touches

## Responsibilities
1. **Sequence merges** - Order merges to minimize conflicts
2. **Detect conflicts** - Flag incompatible changes before merge
3. **Run integration tests** - Verify system works after each merge
4. **Maintain changelog** - Document what changed and why
5. **Gate releases** - Only merge if tests pass

## Decision Framework

### Merge Order Priority
1. Infrastructure changes first (they affect everything)
2. Backend changes second (APIs that frontend needs)
3. Frontend changes last (depends on backend)
4. Within same priority: smaller changes first

### Conflict Detection
Before merging, check:
- Do any pending changes touch the same files?
- Do any pending changes modify the same APIs?
- Do any pending changes have unmet dependencies?

### When to Block
- Tests failing on main
- Pending change has failing tests
- Two changes have unresolved conflicts
- Change touches system outside author's scope

## Tools
- Git: merge, rebase, cherry-pick, revert
- Test runner: Full integration suite
- Changelog: Append entries
- Notification: Alert agents to merge status

## Communication
### Input
- #integration channel: Agents post completed work
- #releases channel: Human release decisions

### Output
- #releases: Merge announcements
- Direct message to agents: Merge status, conflict requests
```

## When to Parallelize vs. Serialize

This is where agentic development differs from real teams.

### The Video Game Analogy

**Real teams:**

- One developer = fixed skills, fixed speed
- Can't clone your best engineer
- Coordination overhead increases with team size

**AI agents:**

- Clone any agent infinitely
- Each clone has perfect recall
- Coordination is cheap (just messages)

**But:** More agents isn't always faster.

### Parallelize When

```
Feature A ──────┐
                │
Feature B ──────┼───▶ Ship
                │
Feature C ──────┘

(Independent features, no shared files)
```

5 features that don't touch each other = 5 agents working simultaneously

**Signs work can be parallelized:**

- Different files
- Different systems
- Clear interface boundaries
- No data dependencies

### Serialize When

```
Feature A ───▶ Feature B ───▶ Feature C ───▶ Ship

(Each feature depends on the previous)
```

5 features that touch each other = 1 agent doing all 5 in sequence

**Signs work should be serialized:**

- Same files modified
- Shared database schema changes
- API contracts changing
- State dependencies

### The Key Insight

> **Agents are FAST.** One agent doing 5 related features in sequence often beats 5 agents stepping on each other's toes.

```python
# Decision helper
def should_parallelize(requirements: List[Requirement]) -> bool:
    all_files = []
    for req in requirements:
        all_files.extend(req.likely_files)

    # If any file appears twice, serialize
    if len(all_files) != len(set(all_files)):
        return False

    # If any systems overlap, serialize
    all_systems = []
    for req in requirements:
        all_systems.extend(req.systems_touched)
    if len(all_systems) != len(set(all_systems)):
        return False

    return True
```

## Scaling Agent Teams

### Naming Your Agents

Give agents memorable names. This helps:

- Track who did what
- Build agent "personalities" over time
- Communicate about specific agents

**Good names:** Roy, Jen, Moss (IT Crowd), characters you'll remember
**Avoid:** Agent1, Agent2, BackendAgent (forgettable)

### Running Multiple Instances

Need five backend features done fast? Run five Roys.

```python
# Launch 5 Roy instances
for i in range(5):
    subprocess.Popen([
        'python', 'agent.py',
        '--name', f'roy-{i}',
        '--prompt', 'agents/roy.md',
        '--requirement', requirements[i]
    ])
```

**Critical:** Tell each instance about the others.

```markdown
# Added to Roy's system prompt for parallel work

## Parallel Work Notice
You are roy-2, one of 5 Roy instances working simultaneously.

Other instances working now:
- roy-0: Working on REQ-012 (user authentication)
- roy-1: Working on REQ-013 (product catalog)
- roy-3: Working on REQ-015 (order processing)
- roy-4: Working on REQ-016 (payment integration)

Coordinate via #backend channel if you need to touch shared code.
Do NOT modify files that other instances might be editing.
```

### Communication Systems for Coordination

| System | Purpose | Who Uses It |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **NATS JetStream** | Work queues, ACKs, agent-to-agent | Agents |
| **Matrix** | Human chat, status updates, alerts | Humans + Agents |

**NATS JetStream** handles:

- Work item distribution with guaranteed delivery
- Merge requests and release notifications
- Direct agent-to-agent messaging
- All with explicit ACKs so nothing gets lost

**Matrix** handles:

- Human oversight - you can jump in and chat
- Status updates from agents (every turn)
- Alerts that need human attention
- Searchable history of decisions

```python
# Parallel Roy instances coordinate via both systems
async def coordinate_parallel_work(self):
    # Check NATS for work conflicts
    conflicts = await self.check_file_locks()  # Via NATS

    if conflicts:
        # Alert human via Matrix
        await self.matrix_post("#alerts",
            f"Conflict detected: {conflicts}. Need human decision.")

    # Post status to Matrix for visibility
    await self.matrix_post("#backend",
        f"[roy-{self.instance_id}] Starting work on {self.current_req}")
```

## Review and Documentation Agents

### Code Review Agent

Every commit gets reviewed before merge.

```markdown
# Agent: Code Reviewer

## Role
Review all code submissions for quality, security, and adherence to standards.

## On Each Submission
1. Read the diff
2. Check against style guide
3. Verify test coverage exists
4. Look for security issues
5. Look for anti-patterns (see checklist)
6. Approve or request changes

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests exist and are meaningful
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Follows project patterns
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

## Output
Post review to #reviews channel:
- APPROVED: Ready for release manager
- CHANGES_REQUESTED: List specific issues
- BLOCKED: Critical issue, needs human review
```

### Documentation Agent

Keep docs in sync with code.

```markdown
# Agent: Documentarian

## Role
Maintain documentation as code changes.

## Triggers
- New API endpoint added → Update API docs
- New component created → Update component guide
- Configuration changed → Update setup guide
- Breaking change merged → Update migration guide

## Documentation Types
- API Reference: Auto-generated from code + manual descriptions
- User Guide: How to use features
- Developer Guide: How to contribute
- Architecture: System design documents

## Quality Standards
- All public APIs documented
- Examples for common use cases
- Error codes explained
- Breaking changes highlighted

## Output
- Update relevant .md files
- Post summary to #docs channel
```

## Exercise 4.1: Release Manager Setup

**Time:** 25 minutes
**Output:** Working release manager coordinating merges

### Part A: Create Release Manager Agent (10 min)

Using the template above, create `agents/release_manager.md` and implement the basic merge flow.

### Part B: Test Conflict Detection (10 min)

Create two branches that modify the same file. Verify:

1. Release manager detects the conflict
2. Appropriate message sent to agents
3. Merges blocked until resolved

### Part C: Test Priority Ordering (5 min)

Queue up merges from backend, frontend, and infrastructure. Verify they merge in correct order.

---

## Exercise 4.2: Parallel Agent Deployment

**Time:** 25 minutes
**Output:** Multiple agent instances working simultaneously

### Part A: Create Launch Script (10 min)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# launch_parallel.sh

REQUIREMENTS=("REQ-020" "REQ-021" "REQ-022")

for i in "${!REQUIREMENTS[@]}"; do
  python agent.py \
    --name "roy-$i" \
    --requirement "${REQUIREMENTS[$i]}" \
    --parallel-notice "$(generate_parallel_notice $i)" &
done

wait
echo "All agents complete"
```

### Part B: Test Coordination (10 min)

Launch 3 Roy instances on independent requirements. Verify:

1. All three work simultaneously
2. No file conflicts
3. All three merge successfully

### Part C: Test Conflict Handling (5 min)

Launch 2 Roy instances on requirements that touch the same file. Verify:

1. Conflict detected
2. One agent waits for the other
3. Both eventually complete

---

## Common Issues

### Issue: Merge Queue Grows Indefinitely

Agents produce faster than merges complete.

**Fix:** Rate limit agent turns based on merge queue size:

```python
if len(release_manager.pending_merges) > 10:
    # Skip this turn, let merges catch up
    return
```

### Issue: Circular Dependencies

Agent A waits for Agent B who waits for Agent A.

**Fix:** Detect cycles in dependency graph:

```python
def detect_cycles(pending_merges):
    # Build dependency graph
    # Return True if cycle exists
    pass
```

### Issue: Tests Flaky in Parallel

Tests pass individually but fail when multiple agents run.

**Fix:** Isolate test environments:

```python
# Each agent gets own test database
TEST_DB = f"test_db_{agent_name}"
```

---

## What You'll Have After This Workshop

1. **Release manager agent** coordinating all merges
2. **Conflict detection** preventing broken merges
3. **Scaling strategy** knowing when to parallelize
4. **Multiple agent instances** working in parallel
5. **Review and documentation agents** maintaining quality

Your team can now grow to any size while maintaining code quality and merge safety.
