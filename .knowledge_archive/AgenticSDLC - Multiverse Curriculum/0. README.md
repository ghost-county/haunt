# Agentic SDLC

> **Building Software with AI Teams**

This course teaches developers how to build and manage teams of AI agents that autonomously develop software. Move beyond single-agent coding assistance to orchestrated teams of specialists working in parallel.

## What You'll Learn

| Hour | Topic |
|------|-------|
| **Hour 1** | Transform brain dumps into phased roadmaps using Requirements Engine and Business Value Analyst personas |
| **Hour 2** | Set up autonomous workers with mandatory testing pipelines and execution cadence |
| **Hour 3** | Create specialist agents, NATS JetStream queues, and Matrix chat |
| **Hour 4** | Release management, intelligent merging, and scaling strategies |
| **Hour 5** | Anti-pattern detection with senior dev checklists, static analysis, and prompt injection filtering |
| **Hour 6** | Agent memory, 5-layer hierarchy, character development, and self-correction |
| **Hour 7** | Continuous improvement, TDD for agents, behavior testing, and mobile workflows |

---

## Who This Is For

- **New developers** who want to scale their output from day one
- **Experienced developers** who want to parallelize their work
- **Team leads** exploring AI-augmented development workflows

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience (any language)
- Familiarity with git workflows
- Access to Claude API or Claude Code
- Willingness to treat AI as team members, not just tools

---

## Before You Start

> **Critical:** Set up NATS JetStream BEFORE Hour 2. Students who skip this hit coordination failures in Week 1.

The course includes a "Before You Start" setup section. Complete it first:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **NATS JetStream** | Persistent message streams with complete audit trail |
| **Agent memory MCP** | Persistent context across sessions |

JetStream stores every message - you have a complete record of what agents said to each other, which is essential for debugging.

## ⚠️ Critical Warning: Managing Your Execution Velocity

This will sound crude, but it's important:

When AI agents suddenly unblock your execution capability, most people experience what we call **"the diarrhea phase."** You've got years of backlogged projects and suddenly you can build them all. Right now. At once.

**This is incredibly exciting. It's also dangerous.**

> You still need to eat, sleep, and spend time with loved ones.

I've seen multiple developers hit manic episodes when they discover agent-assisted development. If you're prone to project-driven mania, **notify your loved ones NOW**. Tell them your teacher warned you this might trigger hyperfocus episodes.

### Set Hard Limits Before You Start

1. **Set a token budget** - Use Privacy.com to create merchant-locked cards with spending caps
2. **Set time boundaries** - Use timers, actually respect them
3. **Watch for warning signs** - Skipping meals, 3am coding sessions, "one more feature" loops

**The goal isn't to work 10x longer. The goal is to reclaim your time by working 10x faster in focused bursts, then stopping and doing something else with your life.**

📖 **Full guide:** [Handling A Project-Driven Manic Episode](3.%20Handling-A-Project-Driven-Manic-Episode.md) - Read this if you have ADHD, bipolar disorder, or any history of hyperfocus burnout.

**Don't skip this. The projects will be there tomorrow. You need to be there too.**

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Autonomous Workers** | Claude instances that work through roadmaps unsupervised |
| **Specialist Agents** | Named agents with defined scope and tools |
| **NATS JetStream** | Persistent message streams with ACK/NAK for guaranteed delivery |
| **Turn System** | 30-minute cycles where agents drain their queues |
| **Queue Drainer** | Pull-based message consumption with explicit acknowledgments |
| **Matrix Chat** | Human-agent interaction and oversight |
| **Release Manager** | Coordinates merges from parallel agents |
| **Core Memories** | Failure memories that drive self-correction |
| **Execution Cadence** | Time-based scheduling with 15-minute offsets to prevent conflicts |
| **5-Layer Memory** | Core, long-term, medium-term, recent, and compost memory layers |
| **REM Sleep Cycle** | Periodic consolidation of episodic memories into semantic patterns |
| **Four-Layer Validation** | Research → Critique → Code → Statistics validation chain |
| **Handoff Templates** | Structured context transfer between agents |
| **Prompt Injection Filter** | Security layer for processing external input |
| **TDD for Agents** | Pattern Found → Test Written → Agent Trained → Pattern Defeated |
| **Behavior Testing** | Regression tests for prompt changes |
| **Mobile Workflow** | claude.ai/code for managing agents from anywhere |
| **PDF RAG** | Semantic search over research papers with FAISS embeddings |
| **Claude Skills** | Reusable capabilities for PDF, XLSX, DOCX, PPTX processing |

## Advanced Material

For teams ready to go deeper, see the comprehensive Agentic SDLC Course at `~/src/superalignmenttoutopia/docs/course/`:

- 10 modules covering agent architecture, MCP servers, quality gates, crisis mitigation
- Case studies from a real project with 4,600+ commits over 23 days
- Why we evolved from files to NATS (so you understand what you're avoiding)
- Student projects for unsolved problems (automatic grading, memory consolidation)

## The Big Idea

**Traditional development:** One developer, one stream of work.

**Agentic development:** Clone your best engineers infinitely. Run 5 Roys at once. Let them coordinate via message queues instead of meetings. Watch them get better through memory and character development.
